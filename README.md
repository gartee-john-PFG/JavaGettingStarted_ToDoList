# JavaGettingStarted_ToDoList
Skeleton for Java for New Engineers to build a console-based ToDo list manager

# Week Four/Five Exercises
## Write a console-based program
* Create a program in this project
    * this is a simple, console-based program
    * Build and manage a TODO list
## Requirements
### Create a Task class that allows you to
* Display the Task in a readable format
* Edit an existing Task
* Tasks have the following characteristics

* Add a new Task
* Edit an existing Task
* Delete an existing Task
* Read the list of Tasks from a local **tasks.json** file
* Write the list of Tasks to a local **tasks.json** file

### Create a console-based program that does the following
We're going to write a small, console-based program that allows us to manager our ToDo list.  it should allow us to read the file from **tasks.json**, save a changed set of Tasks back to **tasks.json**, list our tasks, add/change/delete a task, and exit the program.

The general flow of the program should be to display a list of actions the user can perform, accept a request, perform the request, and return to the original list of actions.


### You can work with a pair, in a mob, or individually
### Create the classes you believe are necessary. It's good to discuss this with other people.
